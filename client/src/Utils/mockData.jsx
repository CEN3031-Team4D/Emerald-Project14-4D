        <p>
          <strong>What is Blockly?</strong><br />
          Think of Blockly as a big box of colorful building blocks. Each block can do something special when you connect them with others. Blockly lets you create computer programs using these fun blocks!
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>How Does Blockly Work?</strong><br />
          - <em>Colorful Blocks:</em> Blocks in different colors mean different things. Like blue for loops and green for decisions.<br />
          - <em>Snap Them Together:</em> Pick and snap the blocks together to make instructions.<br />
          - <em>Tell a Story:</em> Your blocks tell your computer a story that it understands and follows.<br />
          - <em>Create Amazing Things:</em> You can make games, stories, and solve problems with Blockly.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Why is Blockly Fun?</strong><br />
          - <em>No Typing Needed:</em> Just fit the blocks together, and you're coding!<br />
          - <em>Easy to Understand:</em> The blocks are like simple puzzle pieces.<br />
          - <em>See Your Code Come to Life:</em> Watch your ideas turn into action right away!
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember, every great programmer started just like you. With Blockly, you're on an exciting coding adventure. So, let's start building! ðŸš€
